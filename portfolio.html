      <h2>MBTI Personality Chatbot</h2>
      <div style="display: flex">
        <p>Chatbot developed for CS 4742 (Natural Language Processing) utilizing a trained distilBERT model from Hugging Face's transformers API that takes in an input and predicts their personality based on their input. The model was trained on a mix of a dataset found on the popular dataset website Kaggle, but a majority of the data was synthetically generated via various means. In training the model had an overall accuracy of 93% with a dataset consisting of same amount of personality types. The front end of the chatbot was implemented using Flask in combination with traditional HTML, JavaScript, and CSS</p>

In order to do this we used frameworks such as react.JS to develope a website that user can use to access our object detection system capable detecting and classifying bees on the tribe level that we have devolved. Work with several other club members to develope the front-end, as well as work with other groups to properly implement their and our work together in a seamless manner.</p>

        <p>Program I developed in my CS 3642 (Artificial Intelligence) class for the assignment #1 in the class. The task for this assignment was to create a basic AI agent and implement it in a program. For the assignment I created 2 basic AI agents one plays the role of the dealer against the player. The other can be toggled on and off and plays in place of the player. The program was designed in a way so that it can be used as a demonstration of the AI agents or be a fun game for the user to play. The program was programmed in the C# programming language using the windows form framework.</p>

      <div style="display: flex">
        <p>I participated in the spring 2024 Hackathon at Kennesaw State University. The idea me and my team came up with was to try help deaf people and visual listeners connect more easily with the world. Our original plan to implement this was to use an AR headset to capture the world around the user and place text above each person’s head who is currently talking near the user. However, we had to pivot since the AR headset display didn’t look professional. Because of this we ended up using an Android app to simulate the AR experience in our demonstration. To create the android app we used Android Studios. We were able to develop the app to convert speech to text in real-time and used Google’s Detect Faces API to locate the face of the person speaking and set the text above the people.</p>

      <div style="display: flex">
        <p>Program designed for the 2nd assignment in my CS 3642 (Artificial Intelligence). For this assignment I was tasked with creating a program that can solve the 8 puzzle problem using various search algorithms (depth-first, Uniform-cost, best-first, and A*). After this the program would display the solution it found using the chosen algorithm and display the amount of moves it took to discover the solution and how long the solution is. I also programmed it where the user and choose any end state or randomly have one selected randomly. The puzzle is also playable by the user so the program can double as a fun past-time people can play to provide entertainment while also improving cognitive skills.</p>

        <p>The final group project for my SWE 3313 (Intro to Software Engineering) class. This program was made in a group of 4 team members including myself. The goal of the project was to simulate what the real world software engineering process is like. We accomplished this by being task with create the in-house software that would be used in a fictional restaurant. We were given a set of goals our minimum viable product would have to meet and for any additional information we would have to reach out to the client (the professor). In this project we used the agile software engineering method called scrum to keep us on track. Outside of the final program we also needed to create several documents during the software engineering process to ensure we were on track to meet our deadline.</p>

      <h2>CS 3642 Assignment #3</h2>
      <div style="display: flex">
        <p>The 3rd assignment for my CS 3642 (Artificial Intelligence) class was to make a perceptron capable of training itself to solve the three black squares problem and then demonstrate it in another fashion. The problem I decided to demonstrate the capability of the perceptron was a movie prediction algorithm that would predict the odds a user of a streaming app would like a movie (in this example The Matrix) based off of movies they have previously watched. I ran 5 tests to determine the classification accuracy of the perceptron on the three black squares problem, each test has 16 possible states for a total of 80 states. Out of those 80 total states 78 were correct. With 2 of them being false positives that determine the 4 blocks were dark when only 2 of the squares were black and 2 were white. That being said, 78 / 80 is still a great success rate at a 97.75% classification Accuracy. It is hard to calculate the accuracy of the movie prediction perceptron since whether or not a person would enjoy a movie is subjective. So, we cannot look at the result and objectively say whether or not the weights are accurate. But we can look at them and say that the results show a clear trend, which is exactly the outcome I was are trying to produce from the perceptron.

      <h2>Virtual Operating System</h2>
      <div style="display: flex">
        <p>Semester project for CS 3502 where we created a virtual operating system made from scratch coded in the C++ programming language. The goal of this project was to simulate our own simple operating system so we could get a better idea of how real world operating systems operate and complete both simple and complex tasks. The operating system we created takes in basic instructions and completes operations based on said instructions through the form of processes. It is also capable of running multiple processes on multiple simulated processing cores, the number of which is dependent on the user. To properly accomplish this we had to create a virtual hard-drive, virtual primary memory, virtual processor, virtual bootloader, and a scheduler to place processes from our waiting queue onto an available processor. All of these components and a lot more come together to form a functioning virtual operating system.</p>
